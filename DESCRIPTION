Description: Large-scale biodiscovery data generated by proteomics and genomics requires
    significant time to undertake literautre review to convert data into knowledge. Prioritizing
    which biomolecules to follow-up is often a daunting task. Given ghe lack of bioinformatics tool
    to automate and formalise literautre review of proteomics data, the bioinformatics tool, proteomicsliteratureminer,
    is developed as a solution. The proteomicsliteratureminer is simple to use and streamlines the process of literature 
    retrieval and provides result categorisation to assist researchers select appropriate leads for 
    further research.
